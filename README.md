Big Data Analytics: Flight Delays Prediction
Flight delays pose significant challenges for airlines and passengers, leading to inefficiencies and economic losses. This project leverages big data analytics to predict flight delays by analyzing historical flight records and identifying key contributing factors. By utilizing Hadoop, we process large datasets efficiently, enabling scalable and distributed data analysis.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to extract insights from massive flight data and develop predictive models that estimate delays based on variables such as weather conditions, departure times, airline performance, and airport congestion. The analysis incorporates data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization to highlight trends and patterns in flight delays.

Methodology & Approach
Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Extracted historical flight data from open sources (e.g., FAA, BTS).
Cleaned and transformed raw data for efficient processing using Hadoop MapReduce.
Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified key delay factors using statistical analysis.
Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing trends (seasonality, peak hours, etc.).
Feature Engineering & Model Development:

Selected relevant flight attributes (weather, carrier, departure time).
Built predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to estimate delay probabilities.
Optimized models using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
Big Data Processing & Visualization:

Implemented Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for large-scale storage.
Performed data transformations using Hive for faster querying.
Created interactive dashboards to visualize insights.
Technologies Used
1. Big Data Tools: Hadoop, Hive
2. Programming: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
3. Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project demonstrates the power of big data analytics in improving flight scheduling efficiency and reducing delays, offering valuable insights for airlines and passengers. ðŸš€
